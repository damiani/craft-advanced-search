# Advanced Search for Craft

> Work in progress...

Extension of the Element Criteria Model for Advanced search capabilities, without the need to include complex query logic in the template or specify it in a plugin.

## Supports:

* building complex queries without requiring query logic in template
* searching on external tables, to access records from other plugins
* optimizing query structure based on criteria type
* parsing query strings for search parameters
* mapping query string keys to entry field names
* grouping search results directly in the database query
* paginating results by groups, without breaking groups across pages
* and some more goodies...
